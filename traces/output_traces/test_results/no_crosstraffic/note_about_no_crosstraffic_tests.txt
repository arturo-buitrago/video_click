note_about_no_crosstraffic_tests.txt

These are tests without any kind of cross-traffic or other utilization of the channel, designed to illustrate how the buffer flusher deals with different kinds of bandwidths, on both sides of the router. 
Most bandwidths used are the following:
1Mbps
2Mbps
4Mbps
8Mbps
16Mbps

I also added a couple more for curiosity's sake.

You will see that the larger the discrepancy grows between the bandwidths on both sides of the router, the more extreme results you will get. High input rates and low output rates will lead to almost only keyframes being sent, while the opposite will send each and every frame, but probably in rates so low that it disrupts any video viewing.

NOTE ABOUT NAMING

Medium channel or slow channel are the two original traces given to me at the onset of the project. They are located under video_click/traces/video_traces_as_given .

The first number is the bandwidth of the connection between the two computers, under simulation.

The second number is the virtual bandwidth that click pulls the buffer flusher with.
