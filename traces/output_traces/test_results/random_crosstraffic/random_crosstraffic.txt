This folder contains, as discussed, simulations where a certain percentage of the channel is being used by a random distribution of packages simultaneously to the buffer flusher.

From the network emulator manual:

"The link utilization rate can be set to 0 – 100% of the bandwidth in increments of 0.01%." 
Here I have used three tiers: 25%, 50%, 75%. They can be easily changed at the emulator interface.

I also chose to limit myself to 3 link speeds on both sides (in all possible combinations unless deemed unimportant):
1Mbps, 4Mbps, 16Mbps

"The burst size sets the size of the background traffic blocks and is specified in bytes from 64 – 2,000,000 bytes. The default value is 1500 bytes. 
Larger bursts of background traffic induce greater jitter in the actual traffic."
I have kept the blocks at the default size, seeing how this is roughly the same size of our individual packets.

The distribution used is a Poisson process.

NOTE ABOUT NAMING

Medium channel or slow channel are the two original traces given to me at the onset of the project. They are located under video_click/traces/video_traces_as_given .

The first number is the bandwidth of the connection between the two computers, under simulation.

The second number is the virtual bandwidth that click pulls the buffer flusher with.

The third number is the percentage of utilization of the cross-traffic.
