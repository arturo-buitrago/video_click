abstract = {Software routers based on off-the-shelf hardware and open-source operating systems are gaining more and more momentum. The reasons are manifold: first, personal computer (PC) hardware is broadly available at low cost; second, large-scale production and the huge market spur the manufacturers to closely track the improvements made available by Moore's Law; third, open-source software leaves the freedom to study the source code, learn from it, modify it to improve the performance, and tailor its operation to one's own needs. In this paper we focus only on the data plane performance and compare the default Linux IP stack with the Click modular IP stack in terms of the forwarding throughput. The results are surprising and show that a high-end PC is easily able to fit into the multi-Gigabit-per-second routing segment, for a price much lower than commercial routers.},

This paper presents AiroLAB, a wireless network virtualization solution aimed at providing Wireless Internet Service Providers with an effective tool to support experimental testing of novel network–level solutions on production networks. In the paper, the design choices which lie at the basis of AiroLAB are presented and discussed together with a prototype implementation. The outcomes of measurement activities performed on a small–scale testbed demonstrate the strength of the proposed framework in preserving guaranteed performance for production traffic while allowing several experimental instances to run on a network in operation.},

@article{Kohler2000,
abstract = {Click is a new software architecture for building exible and con gurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classi cation, queueing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router con guration is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets ow along the edges of the graph. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex con gurations easier to write, including pull connections, which model packet ow driven by transmitting hardware devices, and ow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements. Click con gurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click IP router has sixteen elements on its forwarding path; some of its elements are also useful in Ethernet switches and IP tunneling con gurations. Extending the IP router to support dropping policies, fairness among ows, or Differentiated Services simply requires adding a couple elements at the right place. On conventional PC hardware, the Click IP router achieves a maximum loss-free forwarding rate of 333,000 64-byte packets per second, demonstrating that Click's modular and exible architecture is compatible with good performance.},

This paper addresses some special issues in processing and streaming lecture videos, and provides a new approach for real-time content analysis and adaptive transmission of these videos over wireless networks. A content-based analysis method and a buffer-based model are provided to detect content regions and to select content significant key frames, and an adaptive feedback control scheme is applied to transmit properly compressed key frames to accommodate dynamically changing bandwidths in wireless environments, with consideration of the limitations of resolution and computing capability of mobile devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our system in experimental results of adaptive transmission of instructional videos over 802.11b wireless networks to mobile devices.},

Based on dynamic thresholds, it is aimed at improving compression efficiency. It has been trained and tested with real sequences taken from movies and commercials, with very different motion and complexity characteristics, and from low to high bitrates, number of frames per second and formats, with a total of 70000 frames and more than 1500 candidate keyframes. Results are presented achieving up to 2.32 dB average peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement, higher than recent methods in the literature, and even processing time gains, preserving the real-time and low delay conditions in real-time coders.},

abstract = {In general, the scene change for video indexing could be detected by using an appropriate threshold. However, the single fixed threshold value used in previous researches cannot perform well for all videos equally. In this paper, we propose a dynamic threshold method (DTM) in order to improve the performance of the scene change detection. The proposed method utilizes variable parameters obtained from detected cuts and the distribution of cut intervals in order to change the threshold dynamically. In short, the threshold in DTM is lowered in the area where the chance of cut occurrence is high and raised in the area where the chance of cut occurrence is low. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DTM is both computationally low and robust to false alarm.},
